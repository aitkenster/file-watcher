System requirements:

Docker

Assumptions:

- Nested folders do not need to be read, only files

TODO for watcher nodes:
- endpoint to retrieve list of files

TODO for file-aggregator:
- endpoint for client to retrieve sorted list
- handle patch requests concurrently

TODO overall:
- Documentation
- Configuration for multiple nodes

Docmentation
- To run an individual node
- To run a group of nodes

Considerations:
- What if more than one watcher watches the same folder?
- What if list of files is giant? Paginate API

Files API
GET /directory
{
    files: [{
        "name": "filename.txt"
    },{
        "name": "newfile.txt"
    }]
}

GET /files
{
    items: [{
        "name": "filename.txt"
    },{
        "name": "newfile.txt"
    }]
}

PATCH /files
[{
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/files"
    "value": {
        "name": "filename.txt",
    }
}]
