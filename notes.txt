System requirements:

Docker

Assumptions:

- Nested folders do not need to be read, only files

TODO for watcher nodes:
- endpoint to retrieve list of files

TODO for file-aggregator:
- tests and finish adding individual items to list

TODO overall:
- Documentation
- Configuration for multiple nodes

Docmentation
- To run an individual node
- To run a group of nodes

Considerations:
- What if more than one watcher watches the same folder?
- What if list of files is giant? Paginate API

Files API
PATCH /files
[{
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/files"
    "value": {
        "name": "filename.txt",
    }
}]
